"""
Sample test data for demonstration purposes.

This file contains key/value pairs that can be referenced in test
cases.  When writing plain English test steps you may refer to these
values by name.  Drivers can substitute placeholders with the
corresponding values at runtime.  For example, a step might specify
``fill username field with {{username}}`` and the framework will
replace ``{{username}}`` with the value defined here.
