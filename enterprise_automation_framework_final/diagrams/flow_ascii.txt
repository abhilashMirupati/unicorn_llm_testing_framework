This diagram illustrates the highâ€‘level flow of data through the framework.  Inputs such as BRD documents or Postman collections are versioned.  The router dispatches each test case to the appropriate MCP (UI, API, Mobile or SQL).  Each MCP produces evidence and Allure output, and the dashboard exposes version management and test execution capabilities.
