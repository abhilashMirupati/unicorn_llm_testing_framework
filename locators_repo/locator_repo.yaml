Sample Locator Repository
------------------------

This YAML file provides a small set of example locators for both UI
and mobile contexts.  Each entry maps a descriptive key to a
dictionary containing the locator type and value.  The framework will
persist learned locators in a SQLite database (see
``locator_repository.py``) at runtime; this file serves only as a
starting point for static selectors.  You can extend it to include
your own applicationâ€‘specific locators or leave it empty if you
prefer the system to learn everything dynamically.

The structure is as follows:

```
ui:
  key:
    type: css | xpath | text
    value: <selector>
mobile:
  key:
    type: accessibility_id | id | xpath
    value: <locator>
```
"""

ui:
  login_button:
    type: css
    value: "button#login"
  username_field:
    type: css
    value: "input[name='username']"
  password_field:
    type: css
    value: "input[name='password']"

mobile:
  login_button:
    type: accessibility_id
    value: "LoginButton"
  username_field:
    type: accessibility_id
    value: "UsernameField"
