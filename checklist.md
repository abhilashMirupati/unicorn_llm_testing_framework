## Core Features & Logic

- [x] **RAGAS‑powered BRD → test case generation** implemented in `utils/ragas_utils.py` with positive, negative and boundary variants.  Negative cases invert assertions or inject invalid inputs; boundary cases append long strings for edge coverage.
- [x] **Manual Excel upload & normalisation** supported via pandas; missing columns cause a descriptive `ValueError` and invalid files raise clear exceptions.
- [x] **Allure & dashboard integration**: All pytest tests include `@allure.step` annotations and produce Allure results under `reports/allure`; the dashboard shows a link to the Allure report and warns when the directory is empty.
- [x] **LLM configuration** via `settings.yaml` supports `local` (Ollama) or `cloud` providers (OpenAI/Gemini) with model name, retries and timeouts.  The LLM agent gracefully falls back to heuristics on timeouts or failures.
- [x] **Locator & wait repositories** use YAML/SQLite backends.  Locators are persisted with version numbers; wait selectors are loaded/saved from the YAML repo.  Heuristics and LLM suggestions are used when selectors are missing.
- [x] **Versioning & rollback**: `versioning/version_utils.py` records versions and detects duplicate uploads via composite keys; duplicates are inserted with comments and the version number reused.  Version history is surfaced in the dashboard.
- [x] **Dual Architecture**: Both legacy drivers (`web/`, `mobile/`, `api/`) and new MCP-based architecture (`src/automation_framework/mcp/`) are fully implemented and functional.
- [x] **MCP Router**: Routes test cases to appropriate MCP implementations (UI, API, Mobile, SQL) with automatic classification.
- [x] **Edge‑case handling** is thoroughly coded and demoed in drivers and tests:
  - **LLM timeout/API failure**: LLM calls honour retry/timeouts; on failure the system falls back to deterministic parsing and logs a warning.
  - **Missing data**: Steps without required fields are marked as skipped and do not abort the test run.
  - **Multiple locator matches**: Web driver warns when a selector matches multiple elements and uses the first match.
  - **Partial failures**: Runs with mixed pass/fail/skip results are marked as `partial` and recorded.
  - **WebView not ready**: After navigation the web driver uses `webview_utils.stabilise_webview` (or heuristics) to wait for embedded webviews to load.
  - **Dashboard desync/drift**: The dashboard warns when the Allure results directory is empty or out‑of‑sync with the database.
  - **Swagger mismatch/snapshot hash**: API steps can include a `snapshot_hash`; mismatches raise assertions and tests demonstrate the behaviour.
  - **Duplicate user story upload**: Version manager checks for identical file names and reuses version numbers while flagging duplicates.
  - **Timezone‑sensitive timestamps**: All timestamps are stored in UTC ISO‑8601 format via `utils.db_utils`.
  - **Dependent tests**: Steps may specify `depends_on` to skip later steps when a prerequisite fails.  Web, mobile and API drivers implement this logic and tests validate it.

## Sample Data & Demo Flows

- [x] `data/test_cases.xlsx` contains multiple user stories covering login, error handling and edge conditions; the generator produces positive, negative and boundary cases.
- [x] `tests/` modules provide runnable samples for web, mobile and API automation using the framework's drivers.  They can be executed via `pytest --alluredir reports/allure` to generate an Allure report which the dashboard can display.
- [x] `locators_repo/locator_repo.yaml` and `waits_repo/wait_repo.yaml` include sensible default selectors for demonstration.
- [x] `integration_test.py` provides comprehensive end-to-end testing demonstrating all framework capabilities.

## Documentation & Static Analysis

- [x] `README.md` contains a high‑level architecture overview, diagrams (stored in `diagrams/`), setup instructions for CLI usage, PyCharm and Eclipse, examples of BRD ingestion and test case generation, a LangChain vs. non‑LangChain comparison, and troubleshooting tips for common issues (e.g. missing dependencies, API key configuration, LLM failures).
- [x] Static analysis configurations (`.flake8`, `.pylintrc`, `pyproject.toml`) are included, and all code passes `flake8`, `pylint` and `black` using the specified rules.
- [x] Configuration consolidation: Primary configuration is in `settings.yaml` with deprecated config files properly marked.

## Integration & Testing

- [x] **Integration Testing**: `integration_test.py` tests all components end-to-end including legacy drivers, MCP architecture, LLM integration, utilities, dashboard, and configuration.
- [x] **Self-Testing**: `self_test.py` provides automated testing with sample data.
- [x] **CLI Interface**: `main.py` provides command-line interface for running test cases from files.
- [x] **Dashboard Testing**: Dashboard endpoints are tested and functional.
- [x] **Cross-Platform Support**: Framework works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Production Readiness

- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks throughout the codebase.
- [x] **Logging**: Proper logging with configurable levels and meaningful messages.
- [x] **Security**: JWT-based authentication, configurable user roles, and secure defaults.
